Add a `.proxy`-named file to the document location with content like this (example):\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"^\\/couchdb(.*)$\": {\r\n    \"host\": \"127.0.0.1\",\r\n    \"port\": 5984\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe top-level keys are regular expressions. And the objects to them are the target for the proxy. The content of the first braces is the new request url for the target. So in this example (if you come from `localhost:8080`) you will get `http://localhost:8080/couchdb/foodb` to `http://127.0.0.1:5984/foodb`. \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nJust install devon via npm (don't forget the global flag):\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install devon -g\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Warning\r\nPlease do not(!) use this server in production mode. It has no security features and it will be easy to get secret data from your server. It's really only for local (max. office or something like that) development.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2009-2013 Andr√© Kussmann <zoddy@zoddy.de>\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\r\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\r\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\r\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\r\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-37906634-1","tagline":"Very lightweight development HTTP server written in nodejs"}
