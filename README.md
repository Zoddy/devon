# devserver
Lightweight Development HTTP Server written in nodejs


## Arguments

Set the argument followed by an equal sign and the value, like `--port=9090`.

Argument       |Content        |Description               |Default
---------------|---------------|--------------------------|-------
-d, --daemonize|none \| boolean|daemon server             |false
-h, --help     |none           |shows a short help message|
-p, --port     |number         |port number               |8080
-s, --silent   |none \| boolean|prevents the log messages |false

- `-d, --daemonize` does not need a value (but you can set `true` or `false` if you want)
- `-c, --config` if you not set one, devserver will try to load `.devserver`. if there is no one, it's absolutely ok

## Document location
Some note to where the devserver loads: In the directory where you start, the devserver will take this as document location and all paths in the url are relative to that.

## Proxy
Devserver has a simple reverse proxy handling. Add a `.proxy`-named file to the document location with content like this (example):

```
{
  "^\/couchdb(.*)$": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 5984
  }
}
```

The top-level keys are regular expressions. And the objects to them are the target for the proxy. The content of the first braces is the new request url for the target. So in this example (if you come from `localhost:8080`) you will get `http://localhost:8080/couchdb/foodb` to `http://127.0.0.1:5984/foodb`. 

## Warning
Please do not(!) use this server in production mode. It has no security features and it will be easy to get secret data from your server. It's really only for local (max. office or something like that) development.
